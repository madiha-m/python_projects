    Everything was going well until suddenly, their {device} crashed!  \
    Panicked, {name} tried {verb} the code, but instead, they got {error_message}. \
        \
    Desperate, they turned to their {random_tech_tool} for help, but it only made things {adjective2}.  \
    After hours of debugging, they realized the issue was caused by a missing {random_symbol}!  \
    Frustrated, {name} took a break, grabbed some {snack}, and started {funny_activity} to calm down.  \
    \
    Finally, after {random_number} cups of {beverage}, they fixed the bug and deployed the project.  \
    But just as they celebrated, their manager walked in and said, **"{manager_quote}"**...  \
    And thatâ€™s how {name} learned **never to push code on a Friday!** \n \
