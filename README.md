### Python Projects

#### Project: Madlib

- This project is a traditional Madlib game, where users provide random words (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.), and the program generates a funny or silly story by inserting those words into predefined blanks using string concatenation.

#### Project: Guess the Number (Computer)

- In this game, the computer will randomly select a number, and the player must guess it. The program will provide hints if the guess is too high or too low until the correct number is found.
